## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **HTTP ingest API** (spec 08): scanner accepts content items via POST
  `/v1/ingest` on a dedicated port (9091), replacing the shared staging PVC
  between connectors and the scanner. Connectors POST multipart
  (metadata JSON + content bytes) instead of writing to a shared filesystem.
  Eliminates RWX PVC requirement, co-location constraints, and fsGroup
  permission issues in Kubernetes deployments.
- `StagingBackend` interface: abstracts item delivery mechanism.
  `StagingWriter` (filesystem) and `HTTPStagingBackend` (HTTP ingest) both
  implement it. Backend selected automatically by `connector.Run` based on
  `GLOVEBOX_INGEST_URL` (HTTP mode) or `GLOVEBOX_STAGING_DIR` (filesystem mode).
- Ingest handler with atomic write (`.ingest-tmp/` rename), backpressure via
  atomic counter (429 with Retry-After), startup readiness gate (503 until
  initialized), strict multipart validation (reject missing/duplicate/unexpected
  parts), configurable size limits (256KB metadata, 64MB body).
- `HTTPStagingBackend` with exponential backoff + jitter retry on 429/5xx/network
  errors. Honors Retry-After header. Returns PermanentError on 400/413.
  `X-Glovebox-Connector` header on every request.
- Unified receive metrics: `glovebox_items_received_total` (source, status),
  `glovebox_receive_duration_seconds`, `glovebox_receive_bytes_total`,
  `glovebox_staging_queue_depth` (atomic counter). `source` label threads
  through entire pipeline for end-to-end traceability.
- 5 integration tests proving full HTTP ingest pipeline (end-to-end, identity
  merge, backpressure recovery, validation rejection, server restart).
- Design specification: `docs/specs/08-ingest-api-design.md`

### Changed

- **Helm chart v0.3.0**: major overhaul
  - Connectors default to HTTP ingest (`GLOVEBOX_INGEST_URL`); staging PVC mount
    removed. Per-connector `ingestMode` toggle (default: `http`, option:
    `filesystem`) for backward compatibility.
  - New ingest Service (ClusterIP, port 9091) for scanner
  - Scanner NetworkPolicy: port 9091 restricted to connector pods, port 9090
    (metrics) unrestricted. Separate ports prevent NetworkPolicy bypass.
  - Standard `app.kubernetes.io/*` labels on all resources
  - `podSecurityContext` (runAsNonRoot, runAsUser, fsGroup) on all deployments
  - `containerSecurityContext` (allowPrivilegeEscalation: false, drop ALL) on all containers
  - ServiceAccount with `automountServiceAccountToken: false`
  - `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` on all PVCs (prevents data loss on uninstall)
  - Configurable `accessMode` per PVC (staging defaults to ReadWriteMany for
    filesystem mode, ReadWriteOnce sufficient for HTTP mode)
  - `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, `tolerations` on scanner and all connectors
    (connectors inherit from top-level values, overridable per-connector)
  - Config checksum annotations for automatic rollout on ConfigMap changes
  - Liveness/readiness probes on scanner deployment
  - Startup probe on ingest port
  - `nameOverride` / `fullnameOverride` support
  - Consistent naming via `glovebox.fullname` helper across all resources
  - `existingClaim` support for connector state PVCs
  - Per-connector `imagePullPolicy` configuration
  - Ingest config in scanner ConfigMap (port, size limits, backpressure threshold)
  - Removed dead rules.json fallback path
- `ConnectorContext.Writer` deprecated in favor of `ConnectorContext.Backend`
- `connector_items_produced_total` metric deprecated (scanner-side
  `glovebox_items_received_total` is the authoritative counter)
- `StagingItem.Commit()` delegates to backend via `commitFunc` dispatch
- Shared `buildMetadata()` method on `StagingItem` used by both filesystem
  and HTTP backends (eliminates code duplication)
- Chart version bumped to 0.3.0, appVersion to 0.2.3

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Add missing source files for Outlook, Teams, OneDrive connectors (v0.2.2
  shipped test files without source code, causing `go vet` failures)
- Teams test reading wrong filename (`content` instead of `content.raw`)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-05 [BROKEN]

> **This release is broken.** Use v0.2.3 instead.

### Added

- ClientCredentials token source for service-to-service OAuth
- 6 new connectors: Notion, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, Steam, Hacker News, LinkedIn
- YouTube comments (commentThreads API) and caption language metadata
- Gmail connector (OAuth + MIME decoding)
- Google Calendar connector (event polling with updatedMin checkpoint)
- Google Drive connector (delta token change tracking)
- Outlook mail connector (Microsoft Graph)
- Teams messages connector (Microsoft Graph)
- OneDrive activity connector (Microsoft Graph delta API)

### Fixed

- Redact API keys from Steam and YouTube error messages
- staging-tmp path for container deployments
- Helm: existingClaim support for all PVCs, bundled default rules

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Helm chart: `existingClaim` option for all PVCs (staging, quarantine, audit,
  failed, agents, shared) to support bring-your-own persistent volumes

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Unified rules config: `routes` replaced by `rules` with destination + tags
  per rule (backward compatible -- `routes` accepted with deprecation warning)
- Identity and data provenance: metadata.json gains `identity` object
  (account_id, provider, auth_method, scopes, tenant) and `tags` map
- TokenSource interface for authenticated API access
  - StaticTokenSource for PATs, API keys, app passwords
  - RefreshableTokenSource for OAuth2 with atomic token file persistence,
    automatic refresh, 5-minute wait cap, and concurrent-safe access
- WebhookVerifier: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for GitHub, Meta, X
- RuleMatcher: first-match-wins routing with tags (replaces Router)
- FetchCounter: configurable per-source and per-poll fetch limits to control
  throughput cost on large backlogs
- HTTPClient: standardized GloveboxBot User-Agent via RoundTripper, applied
  to all HTTP requests across all connectors
- RateLimiter: reads X-RateLimit-*, RateLimit-*, and Retry-After headers;
  sleeps when exhausted (capped at 5 minutes); pre-emptive slowdown
- RobotsChecker: robots.txt compliance for web-fetching connectors (RSS link
  fetching), with LRU cache, crawl-delay support, SSRF-safe redirect handling
- Round 2 connectors: GitHub (Poll + Listener), GitLab (Poll with pagination),
  Jira (Poll with JQL), Trello (Poll with query param auth)
- Round 3 connectors: LinkedIn (Poll), Meta (Poll + Listener with HMAC),
  Bluesky (Poll with AT Protocol XRPC), X (Poll + Listener with CRC)
- Helm chart v0.2.0: connector deployments via values.yaml, Prometheus scrape
  annotations on all pods, optional ServiceMonitor CRDs
- Community health files: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant 2.1),
  SECURITY.md (vulnerability reporting), CONTRIBUTING.md (DCO, standards)
- Executable demos in examples/ (showboat format)
- Design specifications for auth/provenance (06) and fetch controls (07)

### Changed

- BaseConfig accepts both `rules` and `routes` (routes deprecated)
- ConnectorContext gains Matcher (was Router), FetchCounter, and Metrics fields
- StagingWriter merges rule tags and config identity into metadata on Commit
- ItemOptions gains Identity, Tags, and RuleTags fields
- Glovebox validates identity sub-fields and tags in metadata
- Audit log entries include identity and tags
- All 10 connectors use standardized GloveboxBot User-Agent
- All 10 connectors enforce FetchCounter limits in poll loops
- Generator templates use `rules`/`RuleMatcher` (was `routes`/`Router`)

### Removed

- Old Router/Route types (replaced by RuleMatcher/Rule)

### Fixed

- Watcher readiness gate: metadata.json presence check before dispatching
  items, with periodic poll fallback for networked/virtualized mounts
- Meta connector: access token moved from URL query param to Authorization
  header (prevents token leaking into error messages)
- RoundTrip: clone request before setting headers (http.RoundTripper contract)
- robots.txt: SSRF prevention (http/https only), bounded read (512KB cap)
- Generator: templates use package main (was package name, wouldn't compile)
- Meta webhook: reflected XSS via hub.challenge (set Content-Type text/plain)
- CI: CodeQL action bumped to v4 (Node.js 24 compatible)
- CI: explicit CodeQL workflow for Go only (was auto-detecting Ruby)
- CI: Docker builds parallelized via matrix (11 concurrent vs sequential)
- Contact emails updated in SECURITY.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
