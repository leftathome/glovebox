# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Health-data provenance + subject resolution (spec 15, SP1)** -- the
  Glovebox-side foundation for ingesting health data fetched from
  credentialed sources (initially Kaiser Permanente WA via the recognizer
  using the walhelm-go library). See
  `docs/specs/15-health-provenance-and-subject-resolution-design.md`.
  - **Archive contract extension:** new `archive/walhelm-export` media type
    (tar) and producer-asserted provenance keys on the spec-13
    `Upload-Metadata`: acquisition identity (`acq_provider`,
    `acq_account_id`, `acq_auth_method`) and an opaque subject principal
    (`data_subject`) plus optional `audience`. The finalize receipt
    (`metadata.json`) now records an `acquisition` identity block and the
    producer-asserted `data_subject`/`audience`. Other media types are
    unchanged (the provenance keys are required only for walhelm-export).
  - **Known-subjects registry** (`internal/subject/`): an operator-maintained
    allowlist mapping opaque source principals (e.g. `walhelm:<id>`) to an
    opaque Glovebox `entity_id`. PHI/PII firewall -- the data plane (staged
    items, routing, audit log) carries only opaque `entity_id`s; an optional
    `display` label is non-functional and never emitted. Cross-connector
    normalization (one entity, many principals); rejects principal/entity_id
    collisions at load.
  - **Fail-closed subject-resolution gate** at the routing decision: items
    carrying a `data_subject` are resolved to their `entity_id` (rewriting
    the staged metadata) before delivery; subjects that do not resolve are
    quarantined with reason `subject_unresolved` when the registry enforces.
    Enforcement lives in the registry file's `enforce` field (default
    **false**) -- with an empty registry and enforcement off, behavior is
    unchanged and subjectless items (every existing connector) bypass the
    gate untouched.
  - **walhelm importer** (`importers/walhelm/`): a one-shot importer that
    reads a finalized `archive/walhelm-export` directory and stages one item
    per tree file, stamping each with the receipt's subject/audience/
    acquisition-identity (the rule matcher chooses only the destination
    agent). Ships with an enricher-runtime Dockerfile, CI binary + image
    build, and a Helm-delivered `subjects.json` registry ConfigMap.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-XX

### Added

- **Schoology connector** (`connectors/schoology/`) -- ingests
  assignments, faculty feed posts, inbox messages, and attachments from
  a parent Schoology account via the
  [schoology-go](https://github.com/leftathome/schoology-go) library.
  Single-container deployment serving all kids in a household. Browser-
  session-cookie authentication (spec 06's pattern for unusual auth
  flows); credentials provisioned via K8s Secret + External Secrets
  Operator + 1Password. Window-scheduled polling with splay (07:00-09:00
  and 15:30-17:30 local on weekdays) plus an authenticated `POST
  /v1/poll` trigger endpoint with 60-second debounce. Implements the
  framework's `Connector` + `Watcher` + `Listener` interfaces. See
  `docs/specs/12-schoology-connector-design.md`.
- Routing-layer tag-based quarantine: items with `tags.parse_status`
  set to `degraded` or `failure_receipt` are routed to quarantine
  regardless of scanner verdict. Audit log records
  `QuarantineReason: "parse_status_tag"`. Enables forensic preservation
  of parse failures for bug-patrol.
- `docs/AUTH-RECOVERY.md` -- operator procedure for Schoology session
  expiry recovery (detect via `kubectl logs`, re-auth on workstation
  via `auth.Login`, update 1Password item, wait for ESO sync, verify).

### Notes

- Schoology session cookies expire approximately every 14 days; the
  connector surfaces expiry as `PermanentError` with a recovery-
  instruction message and exits non-zero so K8s reports
  `CrashLoopBackOff` for alerting. There is no headless refresh path
  for SSO-fronted tenants -- recovery is a manual operator action.
- Uses spec 11 v1.2 audience vocabulary (`guardians`, `caregivers`);
  inbox messages route with `audience: ["guardians"]` standalone
  (parent-level, no specific kid).
- Per-kid `data_subject` values are operator-chosen opaque labels
  (`k1`/`k2`) to avoid placing PII (nicknames, legal names) into
  metadata and audit logs.
- Introduces `auth_method: "session_cookie"` to spec 06's open
  `auth_method` enum.
- Marks several patterns (window scheduler with splay, trigger endpoint
  with debounce, parse-failure receipt synthesis, per-kid opaque
  labels) as candidates for extraction to a future "connector primitive
  base type" when PowerSchool (spec 13) lands.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- New audience enum token `caregivers` -- delegated supervisors and care
  providers (tutors, nannies, AI agents in caretaking roles,
  out-of-household relatives on duty). Orthogonal to `household`; the
  combination `[household, caregivers]` is permitted. See spec 11 v1.2
  §3.4 and the §3.1 glossary.

### Changed (breaking)

- Renamed audience enum token `parents` → `guardians`. Same semantics
  (spec 11 v0.4.0's §3.4 table already documented the token as
  "parents/guardians" parenthetically); the new name matches school and
  legal terminology and is inclusive of bio/adoptive/foster parents and
  legal guardians. The Go constant `AudienceParents` was renamed to
  `AudienceGuardians`. v0.4.0 was less than 24 hours old with no
  external consumers when this change landed; in-repo callers were
  migrated in the same release.
- `guardians` and `caregivers` may now appear standalone in `audience`
  with empty `data_subject` (household-scope interpretation). Prior to
  v0.5.0, role-relative tokens uniformly required `data_subject` to be
  set. `subject` and `siblings` retain that requirement -- they are
  inherently subject-relative.

### Notes

- Spec 11 §3.1 was extended with a `guardians`-vs-`caregivers` glossary
  entry, an architectural stance documenting Glovebox audience as
  coarse (with fine-grained authorization deferred to downstream
  agents), and an "Audience is a snapshot, not a permanent ACL"
  subsection clarifying that lifecycle-dependent access (juvenile →
  adult transition, caregiver contract endings, retention horizons) is
  the downstream agent's responsibility to apply against frozen
  audit-log audience tokens.
- Spec 11 §2.2 explicitly defers medical-care role tokens (`spouse`,
  `medical_providers`, HIPAA-grade sensitivity escalators) until a
  medical-content connector lands with concrete use cases to validate
  against.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- `data_subject` (string) and `audience` ([]string enum) fields on
  `metadata.json`, `ItemOptions`, `Rule`, `MatchResult`, `BaseConfig`
  defaults, and `AuditEntry`. See
  `docs/specs/11-data-subject-and-audience-design.md`.
- Audience enum tokens: `subject`, `parents`, `siblings`, `household`,
  `public`, with validated combinations (spec 11 §3.5).
- `staging.EffectiveAudience()` reader-side helper that applies the
  default `["household"]` when audience is omitted.
- `staging.HasControlChars()` exported wrapper enabling consistent
  control-char policy across connector and staging packages.
- Commit-time validation of `data_subject` length/control-chars and
  `audience` enum + cross-field rules.
- Config-load-time validation of `data_subject_default` and
  `audience_default`: malformed defaults fail startup, not first-item
  commit.
- End-to-end integration test `TestIntegration_DataSubjectAudienceEndToEnd`
  exercising the full spec-11 path: rule -> match -> staging -> metadata.json
  for both data-subject-bearing and subjectless items.

### Notes

- Purely additive schema extension. Existing connectors produce
  byte-identical `metadata.json` files with no code changes.
- V1 is metadata-only: Glovebox validates and stamps these fields but
  does not filter or route on them. Audience-aware routing and
  enforcement are deferred to later specs.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **HTTP ingest API** (spec 08): scanner accepts content items via POST
  `/v1/ingest` on a dedicated port (9091), replacing the shared staging PVC
  between connectors and the scanner. Connectors POST multipart
  (metadata JSON + content bytes) instead of writing to a shared filesystem.
  Eliminates RWX PVC requirement, co-location constraints, and fsGroup
  permission issues in Kubernetes deployments.
- `StagingBackend` interface: abstracts item delivery mechanism.
  `StagingWriter` (filesystem) and `HTTPStagingBackend` (HTTP ingest) both
  implement it. Backend selected automatically by `connector.Run` based on
  `GLOVEBOX_INGEST_URL` (HTTP mode) or `GLOVEBOX_STAGING_DIR` (filesystem mode).
- Ingest handler with atomic write (`.ingest-tmp/` rename), backpressure via
  atomic counter (429 with Retry-After), startup readiness gate (503 until
  initialized), strict multipart validation (reject missing/duplicate/unexpected
  parts), configurable size limits (256KB metadata, 64MB body).
- `HTTPStagingBackend` with exponential backoff + jitter retry on 429/5xx/network
  errors. Honors Retry-After header. Returns PermanentError on 400/413.
  `X-Glovebox-Connector` header on every request.
- Unified receive metrics: `glovebox_items_received_total` (source, status),
  `glovebox_receive_duration_seconds`, `glovebox_receive_bytes_total`,
  `glovebox_staging_queue_depth` (atomic counter). `source` label threads
  through entire pipeline for end-to-end traceability.
- 5 integration tests proving full HTTP ingest pipeline (end-to-end, identity
  merge, backpressure recovery, validation rejection, server restart).
- Design specification: `docs/specs/08-ingest-api-design.md`

### Changed

- **Helm chart v0.3.0**: major overhaul
  - Connectors default to HTTP ingest (`GLOVEBOX_INGEST_URL`); staging PVC mount
    removed. Per-connector `ingestMode` toggle (default: `http`, option:
    `filesystem`) for backward compatibility.
  - New ingest Service (ClusterIP, port 9091) for scanner
  - Scanner NetworkPolicy: port 9091 restricted to connector pods, port 9090
    (metrics) unrestricted. Separate ports prevent NetworkPolicy bypass.
  - Standard `app.kubernetes.io/*` labels on all resources
  - `podSecurityContext` (runAsNonRoot, runAsUser, fsGroup) on all deployments
  - `containerSecurityContext` (allowPrivilegeEscalation: false, drop ALL) on all containers
  - ServiceAccount with `automountServiceAccountToken: false`
  - `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` on all PVCs (prevents data loss on uninstall)
  - Configurable `accessMode` per PVC (staging defaults to ReadWriteMany for
    filesystem mode, ReadWriteOnce sufficient for HTTP mode)
  - `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, `tolerations` on scanner and all connectors
    (connectors inherit from top-level values, overridable per-connector)
  - Config checksum annotations for automatic rollout on ConfigMap changes
  - Liveness/readiness probes on scanner deployment
  - Startup probe on ingest port
  - `nameOverride` / `fullnameOverride` support
  - Consistent naming via `glovebox.fullname` helper across all resources
  - `existingClaim` support for connector state PVCs
  - Per-connector `imagePullPolicy` configuration
  - Ingest config in scanner ConfigMap (port, size limits, backpressure threshold)
  - Removed dead rules.json fallback path
- `ConnectorContext.Writer` deprecated in favor of `ConnectorContext.Backend`
- `connector_items_produced_total` metric deprecated (scanner-side
  `glovebox_items_received_total` is the authoritative counter)
- `StagingItem.Commit()` delegates to backend via `commitFunc` dispatch
- Shared `buildMetadata()` method on `StagingItem` used by both filesystem
  and HTTP backends (eliminates code duplication)
- Chart version bumped to 0.3.0, appVersion to 0.2.3

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Add missing source files for Outlook, Teams, OneDrive connectors (v0.2.2
  shipped test files without source code, causing `go vet` failures)
- Teams test reading wrong filename (`content` instead of `content.raw`)

### Added

- Unified rules config: `routes` replaced by `rules` with destination + tags
  per rule (backward compatible -- `routes` accepted with deprecation warning)

- FetchCounter: configurable per-source and per-poll fetch limits to control
  throughput cost on large backlogs
- HTTPClient: standardized GloveboxBot User-Agent via RoundTripper, applied
  to all HTTP requests across all connectors
- RateLimiter: reads X-RateLimit-*, RateLimit-*, and Retry-After headers;
  sleeps when exhausted (capped at 5 minutes); pre-emptive slowdown

- ConnectorContext gains Matcher (was Router), FetchCounter, and Metrics fields
- StagingWriter merges rule tags and config identity into metadata on Commit
- ItemOptions gains Identity, Tags, and RuleTags fields
- Glovebox validates identity sub-fields and tags in metadata
- Audit log entries include identity and tags
- All 10 connectors use standardized GloveboxBot User-Agent

- robots.txt: SSRF prevention (http/https only), bounded read (512KB cap)
- Generator: templates use package main (was package name, wouldn't compile)
- Meta webhook: reflected XSS via hub.challenge (set Content-Type text/plain)
- CI: CodeQL action bumped to v4 (Node.js 24 compatible)
- CI: explicit CodeQL workflow for Go only (was auto-detecting Ruby)
